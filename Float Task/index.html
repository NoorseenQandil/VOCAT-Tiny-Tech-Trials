                Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). 
                It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are cheese, 
                sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil.

                These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce. 
                The sauce is most often tomato-based, but butter-based sauces are used, too. 
                The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". 
                Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza. 
                The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. 
                Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine. 
                However, it has become popular in many parts of the world.

                Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped 
                with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other 
                cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, 
                using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
                One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita,
                which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. 
                Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, 
                who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its 
                topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                Italy has many variations of pizza. 
                The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, 
                is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano 
                tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples).
